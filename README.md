# Text Analysis and Sentiment Processing

This project performs text preprocessing and sentiment analysis using NLTK. It cleans text data, tokenizes words, removes stopwords, and analyzes sentiment based on predefined positive and negative word lists.

## Features
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes special characters, converts text to lowercase, and eliminates stopwords.
- **Tokenization**: Splits text into sentences and words using NLTK.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses predefined positive and negative word lists to determine sentiment.


## Data Requirements
Ensure you have `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt` in the same directory as the script. These files should contain lists of words used for sentiment classification.
